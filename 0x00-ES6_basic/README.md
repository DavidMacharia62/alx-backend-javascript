## Introduction to ES6

ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard. It is a scripting-language specification that JavaScript is based on. ES6 introduced significant enhancements to the language, making it more powerful and expressive.

## New Features in ES6

Some key features introduced in ES6 include:
- **let and const**: New ways to declare variables.
- **Arrow Functions**: A concise syntax for writing function expressions.
- **Template Literals**: A new way to define strings with multiline and interpolation.
- **Classes**: A more convenient way to create and inherit objects.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: An efficient way to extract values from arrays and objects.
- **Spread and Rest Operators**: Simplifying array and parameter manipulation.
- **Promises**: A cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Modules**: A standardized way to organize and structure code.

## Constants vs Variables

In ES6, `const` and `let` were introduced for variable declarations.
- **const**: Declares a constant variable, which cannot be reassigned.
- **let**: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.

```javascript
const pi = 3.14;
let count = 0;
```

## Block-Scoped Variables

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block, statement, or expression where they are defined.

```javascript
if (true) {
  let blockScopedVar = 42;
  const constantVar = "Hello";
}
// blockScopedVar and constantVar are not accessible here
```

## Arrow Functions and Default Parameters

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions.
```javascript
// Traditional function
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// Arrow function
const add = (x, y) => x + y;

// Function with default parameters
const greet = (name = "Guest") => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

## Rest and Spread Function Parameters

The rest and spread operators simplify working with function parameters.
```javascript
// Rest parameters
const sum = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);

// Spread operator
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const combined = [...numbers, 4, 5]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## String Templating in ES6

Template literals allow embedding expressions inside string literals.
```javascript
const name = "World";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

## Object Creation and Properties in ES6

ES6 introduced shorthand syntax for object properties and methods.
```javascript
const firstName = "John";
const lastName = "Doe";

// Shorthand property names
const person = { firstName, lastName };

// Shorthand method names
const greeter = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};
```

## Iterators and For-of Loops

ES6 introduced a new iteration protocol and the `for...of` loop for iterable objects.
```javascript
const iterable = [1, 2, 3];

// Using for-of loop
for (const item of iterable) {
  console.log(item);
}

// Creating a custom iterable object
const customIterable = {
  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    let i = 0;
    return {
      next() {
        return { value: i++, done: i > 3 };
      }
    };
  }
};
```
